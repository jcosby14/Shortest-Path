Our Real World Proposal is the shortest path going from the 
Empire State Building to Grand Army Plaza in New York City.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We are doing the weighted calculations based on the time it takes to walk,
take the subway, and drive. We have 4 stations (Penn Station, Wall Street, 
Rector Street Station, Grand Army Plaza Station) and 
3 locations(Empire State Building, 9/11 Memorial, and Grand Army Plaza)
 that will be represented as Nodes.
